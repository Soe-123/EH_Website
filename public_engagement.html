                        <h5>Week 1 – Getting to know ‘Old Flo’</h5>
                        <p>Following
                            some contextual information about the history of Old Flo, the
                            group used their imaginations to explore which characteristics
                            the sculpture would embody if it was alive. With the knowledge
                            of why she was brought to London, they co-decided Old Flo
                            would be a community-minded person, who enjoys socialising
                            and in turn is much loved by the people around her. This narrative building exercise was proceeded by drawing the
                            sculpture from photographs. Each participant focused on a
                            different element of the sculpture, some depicting the whole
                            form, while others focusing on texture, and some even choosing
                            to dissect the sculpture into something more abstract.</p>

                            </picture>
                            <h5>Week 2 – Visualising ‘Old Flo’</h5>
                            <p>The participants were noticeably more comfortable with
                                expressing themselves this week and after a period continuing
                                with their drawings, they were ready to think more boldly about
                                the shapes they were creating. Part of this process meant understanding
                                which were the most important shapes for conveying
                                the aspect of Old Flo they were most interested in capturing.
                                This new perspective of mark-making resulted in a series
                                of stencils. Stencils are an important component of screen
                                printing which the participants would using the following week.
                                In order to test the effectiveness of these, each person used a
                                sponge and colour ink of their choice, to create multiple positive
                                editions of their stencils onto sheets of paper.</p>

                                    <h5>Week 4 – Screen printing ‘Old Flo’</h5>
                                    <p>Off the back of an enjoyable previous week screen printing,
                                        the participants printed further editions of their items. We also
                                        explored new techniques, such as printing a second colour and
                                        masking off areas of a stencil to create level of customisations
                                        to the prints. As well as printing their own designs, participants
                                        printed compositions using other people’s designs, symbolising
                                        the shared process of the workshops. By the end of the workshop, everyone had tote bags,
                                        tea-towels and t-shirts to take away with them. Because of the
                                        usability of these items, rather than simply being pieces of fine
                                        art, they acted as a more purposeful memento, proving value as
                                        gifts or talking points to share with friends and family.</p>

                                        <p>This was the first time the group were together beyond the
                                            usual space for meeting at Toynebee Hall. This week we met at
                                            Old Flo herself on Cabot Square in Canary Wharf. It was a great
                                            chance to get a 360 degree view of the sculpture and we brought
                                            the conversation full circle by again discussing what people
                                            thought Old Flo would be like if she were alive. The group
                                            compared their screen printed designs to the physical sculpture
                                            and displayed them on the plinth she sits on, for passers by to see.
                                            Following that we headed to Canary Wharf Groups’ (CWG)
                                            HQ at Canada One to meet the project’s commisioners and to
                                            discuss the sculpture in a bit more depth over tea and brownies.</p>
