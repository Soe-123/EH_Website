                <p>Supported by <a href="https://eastendcf.org/life-chances/#:~:text=Our%20Life%20Chances%20Fund%20is,residents%20across%20the%20East%20End.">East End Community Foundation</a> as part of their Life Chances campaign, Engage Here received funding to run 12 creative workshops to improve digital skills of older people in Tower Hamlets. </p>

                <p>
                   At this stage we have run five out of the twelve workshops, which have been held at Peabody's Sundial Centre, Poplar Union and Russia Lane Day Centre. All laptops were provided using funding from East End Community Foundation or donations from <a href="https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org">Good Things Foundation</a>. Six of these laptops were gifted to people on a permanent basis, who had no access to any technology at home. We will look to give away a further six devices by the end of the project. 
                </p>    
                <p> 
                   The premise of each workshop was to show older people how to access free creative software online with a view to improving their wellbeing, teach them a practical skill such as setting up an email or accessing useful information on Google and finally answering any questions about technology that they might have.

                    For some participants it meant starting from the beginning, showing them how to turn on a laptop, log in and connect to wifi. We opted to use touch screen devices as we felt this would give the best chance of overcoming an dexterity issues with using a keypad. The creative activities we facilitated were drawing to sound using Google Canvas and Radiooo, creating digital ceramics with Google 3D pottery, making playlists with Playlists for Life and Youtube and colouring in using Google Art Colouring Book.

                    The practical skills we delivered were different for each location, at Poplar union we focused on social media and Google Maps. We discussed how Google maps can tell you how long it will take to get to a location and what public transport can be used to get you there. We also looked at adding multiple stops on a journey and how to pick most efficient route. In terms of social media we picked Instagram, helping to set up accounts and access the app on their smart phones. We discussed the notion of a 'handle' and how that can be shared with people in order to show them your photos. At Sundial Centre we used Google to find websites that gave the participants more information about activities on in their area, such as the local library's website and Hackney Circle. While at Poplar Union we covered Google shopping as way of helping the participants see the best price for items they were interested in buying. This was an outcome East End Community Foundation were particuarly keen to target in light of the cost of living crisis.

                    Our next 2 sessions will be a second at Russia Lane Day Centre, and a first at Caxton Hall COmmunity centre on the 26th and 29th of September respectively. Before we will invite participants wishing to receive further digital skills to Trampery Republic in Canary Wharf for a further 4 sessions. Here we plan to cover more in depth knowledge about connecting with people online, such as using emails and zoom, as well as helping them manage there health better, by booking appointments online or accessing other services like our own.
