                <p>Following an initial 6-week <a href="/make_sense">Make Sense</a> programme, Engage Here received support from <a href="https://www.freespaceproject.org">Free Space Project</a> and funding from the National Lottery to run a year’s worth of sensory workshops at the <a href="https://jameswigg.co.uk">James Wigg Practice</a> in Kentish Town.</p>

                    he Free space Project is a initiative in North London that support arts and community projects. For Engage Here, this meant we were provided with a space within the James Wigg Practice, a local GP surgery in Camden, to deliver sensory art workshops. Whereas most of our workshops exist in settings such as community or cultural centres, hosting workshops in a health setting creates a different level of accessibility. In a direct sense this means users of the practice can be referred by their GP to one of our sessions, resulting in participants getting holistic support in a location they trust and is local to them. While our drop-in policy means that there is a visible positive space in a setting that might otherwise be stressful for users, as well as being a useful way to recruit participants who might be visiting the practice for another reason.

                    The format of the workshops follows our Make Sense programme, which utilises art processes to stimulate the senses. For instance we have been able to mono-print and cyanotype print with nature found in the practice’s garden, as well as respond to local sounds through drawing. The benefit of a long-term programme also means we can repeat processes which participants respond best to and want to explore further. With regular group of 6 participants, as well as a number of drop-ins, it’s been phenomenal to see the sustained improvement in the confidence of participants who come week on week.

                    This programme has been great example of participatory diversity, currently involved we have people living dementia, an adult with cognitive-impairment, and older participants who have not been formally diagnosed with dementia but are experiencing many of the symptoms. It has engaged locals who were already using the GP practice, but has also brought new people to the practice who had never been before, and may in turn get other help useful to them. The programme has also offered opportunities for GP’s and Social Prescribers to get involved. They are able to take part in exactly the same way as the other participants, as a means of giving them a better sense of the service they are referring patients to.
